# Contributing

## Process
If you submit a pull request, please make **1** singular pull request per major change. Do not submit one huge pull request that includes many changes. If an individual change is not approved, this will block your entire pull request from being merged.

Your commits should also be descriptive, properly labeled, and contained. Do not have generic commit labels (e.g. "Improvements", "Changes"), and do not submit commits that include changes outside of the scope of the commit label (e.g. "Fix death messages not showing for players killed by ender dragon" commit label, but commit also touches unrelated kit ability logic).

If you have identified an issue within the plugin and have limited Java experience,
please consider [submitting an issue](https://github.com/cervinakuy/KitPvP/issues) instead.
